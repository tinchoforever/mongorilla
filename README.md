## Why Mongorilla
Mongorilla lets you define your Mongo Document schemas simply by editing a [JSON config file](https://github.com/gerardobort/mongorilla/blob/master/config/default.json).
Once you have the JSON setup, it will generate (on the fly) the administrator views and forms, including dashboards and search tools.
The principle of Mongorilla is to store your documents *the way you defined them* directly in MongoDB.  This means *no extra metadata embeded into your documents*. You can define the documents structure in any way you want!

## Dependencies
Mongorilla is a NodeJS application, distributed via NPM which also have both: NPM and Bower dependencies.  The application is built on top of:
* ExpressJS 4
* Mongoose
* BackboneJS
* Backbone-Forms in combination with Backbone-Deep-Model
* Bootstrap3

## Key features
* Support for multidimentional documents and/with ObjectId document references.
* Support for File/Image uploads against the same MongoDB using GridFS, and/or Amazon S3 buckets.
* Supports rich content, CKEditor come out of the box.
* Revisioning - You can rollback document revisions very easily, by navigating an edition tmieline!
* Customizing Mongorilla from the source code is not as terrible as in other CMSs.  Even tweaking forms, you can create your own editors, create backend hooks and even, re-use the REST API to serve the content to your frontend app.

### Currently Supported Schema Types
* Text
* TextArea
* Number
* Object
* List
* Date
* Datepicker
* DateTime
* Colorpicker
* File
* Image
* Checkboxes

### Building Custom Schema Types (Editors)

Here are the steps for building your own custom editors:

1. Duplicate or create a new editor file at `public/backbone-forms/editors`
2. Add require paths to your editor file at these locations:
    * `public/init.js`
    * `public/views/generic/form.js`
3. Add the correct Mongoose property to the switch statement in `models/generic.js`
4. Add a field to your JSON schema with the type property named after your editor
5. Build out your functionality!

## Roadmap
* Improve documentation
* Make all the configuration (schemas and users) be editable from the same admin panel.
